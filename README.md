# TreeLinq
Attaching Linq-like functionality to hierarchically oriented classes.

### Suggested usage
Since all the functionality is located in the one class 'Tree' the way to go, in my opinion, is simply to copy the file and change the namespace so it matches your project.

Also, for examples on how to use the 'Tree' class, see the 'Tests' project.

### Caveats

The 'Tree' class was the product of a 'lean & mean' programming exercise. It has not been battle tested, so to speak, nor has it been optimized for performance.
